## All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

__You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?__ *I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.* *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

## I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

* I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
* No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
* I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

Saving the world with meals on wheels. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet!

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
